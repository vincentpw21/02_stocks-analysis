# Module Challenge 2: Stocks Analysis
## Overview of Project
The purpose of this project was to demonstrate the ability to use index values in VBA  to simplify and speed up the analysis process at play in the Stocks Analysis. Doing this will allow future in-depth analysis using this resource to be more effective with potentially larger data sets.

## Summary
### Advantages of Refactoring
- Improve readability
- Improve performance or decrease memory usage

### Disadvantages of Refactoring
- The process can be quite time consuming if working with unfamiliar code
- There is a chance of breaking or ceasing the functionality of the code if you are unfamiliar with the code

### Pros and Cons Applied to Challenge
Improved performance is the most clear benefit of refactoring for this assignment. Allowing the code to process quicker has a slight impact in this scenario, but if performed on a larger data set or with more outputs the increased efficiency would be a benefit to the analyst. Leveraging the indexValues variable allowed for this efficiency to be achieved.

We had some understanding of the original steps and processes in this instance. Yet I could imagine a scenario where unfamiliar code could be quite challenging to de-bug in the future. This is quite likely until more experience is gained.
